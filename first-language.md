# What most people didn't know before they start programming

## Your first language is going to stay with you for a long time

That is why it's called the first language. Mastering your first language is important, as it builds foundation of what is possible by programming.

## It won't be your last

If you believe one language is sufficient, you will probably be dissapointed. Programming languages has been evolving rapidly, and there's no one language that does everything best. You can probably still develop native mobile applications with JavaScript at a cost of performance.

## Your language has to be scalable

When you first started, everything will be in a single file. Imagine working on a large project where you have thousand or even million lines of code - you will have to start breaking your codes into smaller files.
This is where things get ugly fast. If you remove a single functionality, you need to ensure it doesn't break. Adding a new functionality without properly removing the old ones will lead to code smell.

This is where languages such as `Golang` shines, as it can detect which variables and packages that are unused and automatically remove them. Imagine doing that on a Java project - it's a nightmare.
