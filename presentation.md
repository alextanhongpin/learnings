## No Code Policy
Presenting codes will make the audience bored, mainly because:

1. It takes time to digest what the code is doing
2. Some audience has no knowledge on the language

Unless the presentation is discussing specific problems, it's better not to show any codes.

## Show Examples

It's better to show the outcome of the code/solution that you are presenting. It gives the audience a better idea on what is main goal of the presentation.
