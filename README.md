### Non-Agile Team in Malaysia

What defines a non-agile team?

+ Project Manager was not involved in the team.
+ Project Manager only cares about the results, not about the process.
+ Long working hours over proper work management
+ Requirements are handled by Stakeholders
+ Holding source code in VM, transfer source code through zipped file
+ Developers have no say in the requirements
+ There are no Business Analysts to handle requirements
+ Hire a lot of QAs to carry out manual testing
+ No requirements, and non-validated requirements for each Sprint
+ Points out mistake in every Sprint Retrospective, but do nothing about it
