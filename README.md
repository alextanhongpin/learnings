## Doing just enough

Most of the time, teams will work on a task. There are two scenarios - they will either overdo it or fail to deliver. Knowing the boundary helps to reduce the time taken to complete the task.

## Knowing when to stop

Is the task the team is working on aligned with the goals we want to achieve. If not, drop the task, document the learnings and move on.

## Words, no action

Realizing a mistake is one thing, taking actions is another.
